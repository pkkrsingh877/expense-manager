# Things to do

1. Initially I want to make sure users can signup and login
2. Next up I want to make sure that users stay logged in by checking the validity of the jwt that we send to their device via cookies.
3. Once the user is properly logged in, I want to send them to a dashboard where I will show them the insights about their expenses. 
4. I will also provide the link to add expense, view all expenses, edit and delete expenses.
5. I also want to give them ability to logout. 
6. Next thing is I want to give them ability to delete their account.
